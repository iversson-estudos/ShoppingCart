This exercise: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart

I will try to implement in this project the things that I've learned on previous chapters of the course, them being:
React Router Dom and ViTest (don't know if the approach is gonna be Test Driven, but there will be tests).
